What is an intal?\
	An intal is a nonnegative integer of arbitrary length which is stored as a null-terminated string of ASCII characters in big-endian style.
	Integer data types supported by C have a range within which all the values of a particular data type fall, intal doesn't have any particular datatype. Hence it can store integer within any range.

Applications of intal:
- For representing and performing operatins on huge integers which cannot be stored in datatypes provided by C
- Computational geometry algorithms.
